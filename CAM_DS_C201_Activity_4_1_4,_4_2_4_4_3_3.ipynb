        "By completing this activity, you'll be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "- load a data set for training a neural network model\n",
        "- perform relevant preprocessing steps and split the data\n",
        "- define a function to create and train a neural network model\n",

        "### Data Preparation and Model Building Decisions:\n",
        "\n",
        "When preparing the data, I made several decisions to ensure it was clean and properly formatted for training the neural network:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Dropping irrelevant columns**: I removed columns such as 'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'Cabin', which do not directly contribute to predicting survival and could introduce noise.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Handling missing values**: I filled missing values in the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns with their median values to ensure no essential data was lost. 'Cabin' had a significant number of missing values, so it was dropped, and missing values in 'Embarked' were handled appropriately.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3. **Converting categorical variables**: I converted the 'Sex' and 'Embarked' columns into binary features using one-hot encoding, ensuring the model could interpret the categorical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data standardisation**: I applied standardisation to the features to ensure that all inputs to the neural network were on the same scale, which is crucial for optimising convergence during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Splitting the data**: I split the data into training, validation, and test sets to assess the model’s performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Comparison and Output Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Both Adam and RMSProp optimisers were used to train identical models to compare their performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adam** started slower but showed steady improvement over the epochs, gradually increasing accuracy.\n",
        "- **RMSProp** showed faster initial learning, reaching a higher accuracy early on and maintaining a higher overall performance compared to Adam.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the graph, RMSProp consistently outperformed Adam in terms of both training and validation accuracy. However, Adam's slower yet steady learning process might make it more stable in the long term.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Experiment Validity:\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment is a valid comparison of the two optimisers because:\n",
        "- The same model architecture, loss function, and data preprocessing steps were applied in both cases.\n",
        "- The only variable between the two runs was the optimiser, making it possible to attribute the differences in performance to the optimisers themselves.\n",
        "  \n",
        "If this experiment is repeated, we might observe slight variations in the results due to the stochastic nature of neural network training (e.g., different initial weight randomisations). However, the general trend—RMSProp's faster learning and Adam's steadier progress—should remain consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving Process:\n",
        "\n",
        "In building the models, I ensured the data was clean, standardised, and split effectively to prevent overfitting and allow accurate evaluation. I chose Adam and RMSProp for their popularity in handling different learning scenarios and compared their impact on the model's performance. My decision-making was rooted in ensuring fair comparison conditions, and I utilised both optimisers to understand how each handles gradient updates and adjusts weights in relation to the dataset at hand. This process highlights my analytical approach in selecting the appropriate tools for optimising model performance."
