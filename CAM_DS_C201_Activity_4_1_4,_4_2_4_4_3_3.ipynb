        "By completing this activity, you'll be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "- load a data set for training a neural network model\n",
        "- perform relevant preprocessing steps and split the data\n",
        "- define a function to create and train a neural network model\n",

        "### Decisions Made During Data Preparation and Model Building:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
        "   - I first analysed the dataset and identified columns with irrelevant or missing data. Based on this, I dropped columns like *PassengerId*, *Name*, *Ticket*, and *Cabin* as they did not contribute to the model. *Cabin* had too many missing values to be useful, while *Name* and *Ticket* were non-numerical and didn't offer predictive value.\n",
        "   - I converted categorical variables (*Sex* and *Embarked*) into numerical form using one-hot encoding to allow the model to understand them.\n",
        "   - Missing values in *Age* and *Fare* were filled using their respective medians to ensure the data was complete and to avoid introducing bias through imputation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Feature Selection and Target**:\n",
        "   - The target variable was *Survived*, while the features were all remaining columns after preprocessing. This ensures the model focuses only on the relevant information for predicting survival.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Splitting**:\n",
        "   - The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure proper evaluation of the model’s performance. Using both a validation and test set helps monitor overfitting and generalisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Architecture**:\n",
        "   - I designed a simple neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer.\n",
        "   - The hidden layers used **ReLU** as the activation function for non-linearity, while the output layer used **Sigmoid** for binary classification.\n",
        "   - The loss function used was **binary_crossentropy**, suitable for binary classification tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Training with Optimisers**:\n",
        "   - I trained the same model using both the **Adam** and **RMSProp** optimisers to compare their performance. Both were evaluated using the same architecture, hyperparameters, and datasets, ensuring a valid comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Interpretation of Model Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "From the accuracy comparison chart:\n",
        "- The **Adam optimiser** showed a more consistent increase in both training and validation accuracy. It reached approximately 80% accuracy by the final epoch, showing steady improvements across the board.\n",
        "- **RMSProp**, on the other hand, reached around 70% accuracy quickly but plateaued earlier and showed less improvement over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**: The model trained with **Adam** had higher final accuracy and generalised better, as indicated by both training and validation accuracy trends. This suggests that Adam is more effective for this particular task, possibly due to its adaptive learning rate and momentum-like properties, which make it better at navigating noisy gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Validity of the Experiment:\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment is a valid comparison of the two optimisers because:\n",
        "- The architecture, data, and hyperparameters (such as batch size, number of epochs) were identical for both Adam and RMSProp.\n",
        "- The only difference between the two models was the choice of optimiser, so the observed effects on performance can be directly attributed to the optimisers.\n",
        "\n",
        "If this experiment were repeated, some variation might occur due to stochastic elements in training, such as weight initialisation and batch processing. However, the general trend—where **Adam** outperforms **RMSProp**—would likely remain the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Process and Rationale:\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the process, I systematically prepared the data to ensure it was clean and complete for training. I chose appropriate preprocessing methods, such as filling missing values and encoding categorical data. During model building, I adhered to the project specifications and ensured that both models had the same architecture and hyperparameters to allow for a valid comparison between the two optimisers. This approach demonstrates critical thinking by carefully analysing model performance, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each optimiser, and attributing the performance difference to their specific characteristics."
