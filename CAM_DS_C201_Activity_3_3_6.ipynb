        "\n",
        "## Scenario\n",
        "Hopkins et al. (1999) created the Spambase data set donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set contains 4,601 emails marked as spam or non-spam by a postmaster or individuals. Fifty-seven features aid in classifying emails as spam (e.g. word frequencies and email characteristics). The Spambase data set is used for developing and benchmarking spam detection models, providing a base for analysing the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a data professional, you were tasked by your company to develop a neural network with TensorFlow that can classify emails as spam or non-spam. You were tasked to develop a model based on the Spambase data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "In this portfolio activity, you’ll continue to work with the model you created in Activity 3.2.3: Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning by applying evaluation metrics and a pre-trained model to classify emails as spam or non-spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will complete the activity in your Notebook, where you’ll:\n",
        "- choose the best model based on model performance\n",
        "- make predictions based on the chosen model\n",
        "- convert probabilities to binary predictions and view accuracy, F1 score, and recall\n",
        "- present your insights based on the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assessment criteria\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can critically select appropriate strategies to demonstrate expertise in model-tuning techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guidance\n",
        "1. Continue to work on the model you created in **Activity 3.2.3**.\n",
        "2. Select the best model you obtained through hyperparameter tuning. Substantiate your choice.\n",
        "3. Run the chosen model again and save it in an `h5` file named `best_model.h5`. Remember to specify the path.\n",
        "4. Check further metrics for the model with the predict function applied to your model variable in order to create predictions on the `X_test` data set.\n",
        "5. Convert probabilities to binary predictions and print the accuracy, F1 score, and recall. You can use the following code:\n",
        " - predictions: `y_pred = (y_pred > 0.5).astype(int)`\n",
        " - confusion matrix metrics: `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score` and `f1_score` functions."
