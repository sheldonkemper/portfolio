        "## Scenario\n",
        "You are a self-employed data scientist, with a portfolio of clients. Across five use cases, you will apply hypothesis testing to make recommendations to each organisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal is to apply hypothesis testing to a selection of real-world scenarios to validate assumptions about business challenges and to guide strategic decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assessment criteria\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "- demonstrate proficiency in hypothesis testing using Python for data-driven decision-making\n",
        "- interprete results and deduce meaningful conclusions\n",
        "- provide a brief, but informative summary to the stakeholder(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guide\n",
        "1. Study the example before you start with **Scenario 1**.\n",
        "2. Complete the text entry for each scenario, restating the problem statement as a hypothesis.\n",
        "3. Add your hypotheses to the hypothesis variables in the code, and then run the code cell.\n",
        "4. Interpret the results.\n",
        "5. Write a sentence to explain your results to the organisation.\n",
        "6. For Scenario 5, you will select which test to use, write the code, and then apply the above steps to complete the activity.\n"

        "We want to determine whether a cosmetics salesperson’s annual salary is high enough to meet repayments on a loan. The base salary is not very high, but this income is supplemented by commission on sales. We need to explore whether the applicant’s salary plus the commission will meet affordability (the ability to repay the loan) across various affordability testing aspects.\n",
        "Full affordability tests are recorded on applicants' credit files, so we will do a quick initial statistical test to work out if the commission does make enough of a difference, as this will not leave a credit footprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to know what the average annual commission is, as this will have a significant impact on the applicant's ability to make loan repayments, and have established that an average rate of £501 would meet the requirements. The applicant has indicated that, on average, they make approximately £550 in commission a month, which would be sufficient. However, sales could fluctuate, which would reduce the commission.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to test how fluctuations in commission will affect affordability, and a one-tailed t-test performed on a year’s worth of actual data (12 months' of commission by month), plus some additional randomised figures to represent potential future fluctuations will reveal how significant differences in earnings through commission may affect affordability.\n",
