                    <p>
                        Welcome! I'm <strong>Sheldon Kemper</strong>, a Data Engineer with a deep passion for problem-solving. From an early age, I've been fascinated by uncovering solutions and optimising processes, which naturally led me to a career where I could transform data into actionable insights. I specialise in creating and optimising data solutions using Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks, focusing on building efficient data pipelines that empower businesses to streamline operations and make data-driven decisions with tangible impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My career journey has been one of evolution and overcoming challenges. Transitioning from a Risk Manager to a Business Insights Manager, and now a Data Engineer, I’ve adapted my skills to meet new demands and deliver results. This progression has not only expanded my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of how data shapes business strategies and influences outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in machine learning and advanced analytics through the <em>Data Science Career Accelerator</em> at the University of Cambridge. My goal is to utilise these skills to provide deeper insights that help businesses not only understand their past actions but also shape their future strategies effectively. I’m driven by the belief that the right data, interpreted accurately, can transform decision-making and drive innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m enthusiastic about collaborating on opportunities where data can make a meaningful impact. If you’re interested in discussing data engineering, machine learning, or innovative projects that harness the power of data, let’s connect!

                            <p>
                                In this project, I applied machine learning models—XGBoost and a neural network—to predict student dropout rates. Using a dataset of over 25,000 student records, I performed data cleaning and feature selection to retain 11 key features, including attendance rates, contact hours, and unauthorised absences. The models were fine-tuned using techniques like GridSearchCV, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The neural network achieved an accuracy of 97.53%, slightly outperforming the XGBoost model. The analysis highlighted the importance of academic performance and engagement in predicting student success, providing actionable insights for educational institutions to intervene early and support at-risk students.

                            <p>This notebook explores anomaly detection in a ship's engine dataset using machine learning
                                 algorithms. Key methods include One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest to identify anomalous
                                  engine behaviour based on operational parameters such as engine RPM, lubrication oil pressure,
                                   and coolant temperature. The project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering,
                                    and visualising results using techniques like PCA. 
                                    Both One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest are compared, with tuning applied to improve 
                                    model performance,ultimately aiming to enhance predictive maintenance and reduce the 
                                    risk of engine failures.</p>

                            <p>This notebook focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms. 
                                It processes an e-commerce dataset to create key features like frequency, recency, 
                                customer lifetime value (CLV), and average unit cost. The K-means clustering algorithm 
                                is used to group customers, with the optimal number of clusters determined using the 
                                Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and 
                                t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are applied for dimensionality 
                                reduction and cluster visualisation. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to enhance marketing strategies.</p>
