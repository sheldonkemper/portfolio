                    <p>
                        Welcome! I'm <strong>Sheldon Kemper</strong>, a Data Engineer with a deep passion for problem-solving. From an early age, I've been fascinated by uncovering solutions and optimising processes, which naturally led me to a career where I could transform data into actionable insights. I specialise in creating and optimising data solutions using Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks, focusing on building efficient data pipelines that empower businesses to streamline operations and make data-driven decisions with tangible impact.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My career journey has been one of evolution and overcoming challenges. Transitioning from a Risk Manager to a Business Insights Manager, and now a Data Engineer, I’ve adapted my skills to meet new demands and deliver results. This progression has not only expanded my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of how data shapes business strategies and influences outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently completed the <em>Data Science Career Accelerator at the University of Cambridge</em>, 
                        further strengthening my expertise in machine learning and advanced analytics. 
                        My goal is to leverage these enhanced skills to provide deeper insights that help businesses not only understand their past actions 
                        but also shape future strategies more effectively. 
                        I’m driven by the belief that the right data, interpreted accurately, can transform decision-making and propel innovation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m enthusiastic about collaborating on opportunities where data can make a meaningful impact. If you’re interested in discussing data engineering, machine learning, or innovative projects that harness the power of data, let’s connect!

                            <p>
                                In this project, I delve into the transformative potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agent-based architectures 
                                within the financial services space. Leveraging large language models to retrieve targeted data in real time, combined with purpose-built AI agents, 
                                creates a framework that ensures robust data governance and real-world impact. By integrating these components into existing infrastructures, 
                                organizations unlock faster analytics, more dynamic decision-making, and enhanced scalability for critical financial applications. 
                                This forward-looking approach not only drives seamless data connectivity, 
                                but also enables meaningful insights that align with evolving industry demands.

                                In this project, I examine the power of time series forecasting to eliminate uncertainty and drive data-informed strategies. 
                                Through robust modeling techniques—ranging from classic ARIMA to deep learning frameworks—businesses can derive forward-looking 
                                insights that inform everything from resource allocation to market positioning. By embracing these predictive methodologies, 
                                organizations transcend reactive planning and gain the agility needed to navigate rapid industry shifts, 
                                ultimately delivering sustained value in an increasingly competitive landscape.

                            <p>
                                In this project, I applied machine learning models—XGBoost and a neural network—to predict student dropout rates. 
                                Using a dataset of over 25,000 student records, I performed data cleaning and feature selection to retain 11 key features, 
                                including attendance rates, contact hours, and unauthorised absences. 
                                The models were fine-tuned using techniques like GridSearchCV, 
                                and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. 
                                The neural network achieved an accuracy of 97.53%, slightly outperforming the XGBoost model. 
                                The analysis highlighted the importance of academic performance and engagement in predicting student success, 
                                providing actionable insights for educational institutions to intervene early and support at-risk students.

                            <p>This notebook explores anomaly detection in a ship's engine dataset using machine learning
                                 algorithms. Key methods include One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest to identify anomalous
                                  engine behaviour based on operational parameters such as engine RPM, lubrication oil pressure,
                                   and coolant temperature. The project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering,
                                    and visualising results using techniques like PCA. 
                                    Both One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest are compared, with tuning applied to improve 
                                    model performance,ultimately aiming to enhance predictive maintenance and reduce the
