                    <p>Welcome! I'm Sheldon Kemper, a Data Engineer who loves turning data into meaningful insights! I specialise in creating and fine-tuning data solutions using Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks. 
                        My focus is on building efficient data pipelines that help businesses improve operations and make better decisions.                        
                        <br>Right now, I’m expanding my skills in machine learning and advanced analytics through the Data Science Career 
                        Accelerator at the University of Cambridge. I'm excited to use these new skills to solve big challenges and contribute to data-driven projects.</p>

                            <p>This notebook explores anomaly detection in a ship's engine dataset using machine learning
                                 algorithms. Key methods include One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest to identify anomalous
                                  engine behaviour based on operational parameters such as engine RPM, lubrication oil pressure,
                                   and coolant temperature. The project involves preprocessing the data, feature engineering,
                                    and visualising results using techniques like PCA. 
                                    Both One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest are compared, with tuning applied to improve 
                                    model performance,ultimately aiming to enhance predictive maintenance and reduce the 
                                    risk of engine failures.</p>

                            <p>This notebook focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms. 
                                It processes an e-commerce dataset to create key features like frequency, recency, 
                                customer lifetime value (CLV), and average unit cost. The K-means clustering algorithm 
                                is used to group customers, with the optimal number of clusters determined using the 
                                Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and 
                                t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are applied for dimensionality 
                                reduction and cluster visualisation. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to enhance marketing strategies.</p>
