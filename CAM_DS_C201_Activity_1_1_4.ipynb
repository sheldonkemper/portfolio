I began by identifying the nature of the output variable—whether it was continuous or categorical—and considered the type of prediction required (numerical value versus discrete categories). For scenarios involving continuous outcomes, I chose regression techniques, which are suited for predicting numerical values, such as sales forecasts or lifetime customer value. Conversely, for scenarios requiring predictions of categorical outcomes, such as customer churn risk or age groups, I opted for classification methods. This approach ensured that each problem was matched with a model type that best aligns with the nature of the data and the business objective, reflecting a thoughtful consideration of both the characteristics of the data and the strategic needs of the organization.
