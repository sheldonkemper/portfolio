        "As an independent data professional, you have been contracted to evaluate the selling price of automobiles. As part of a biannual industry review, your employer wants to determine whether the selling price of automobiles is correlated with their specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have been provided with a data set, **automobiles.csv**, containing the current selling prices and specifications from randomly selected manufacturers. The data set contains 205 rows and 26 features. You have to apply feature engineering to identify the optimal number of features needed to evaluate and predict the selling prices of automobiles based on the provided specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "Apply dimension reduction with PCA and t-SNE to make predictions in a real-world context.\n",

        "## Assessment criteria:\n",
        "By completing this activity, you will be able to provide evidence that you can:\n",
        "1. Implement PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction.\n",
        "2. Apply PCA and t-SNE to real-world data for improved analysis and visualisation.\n",
        "3. Choose the right number of principal components to balance dimensionality reduction and information retention.\n",
        "4. Evaluate the limitations of PCA and t-SNE.\n",
        "5. Apply critical thinking skills to assessing dimensionality reduction techniques.\n",
        "6. Make informed decisions about the technique based on data characteristics and analysis goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Activity guidance:\n",
        "1. Import the relevant libraries for dimension reduction.\n",
        "2. Normalise the data.\n",
        "3. Transform and visualise the data with PCA and t-SNE.\n",
        "4. Visualise the perplexity of the data.\n",
        "5. Combine PCA and t-SNE and create a final visualisation.\n",
        "6. Jot down your thoughts on the accuracy of predicting selling price based on the specifications of automobiles."
