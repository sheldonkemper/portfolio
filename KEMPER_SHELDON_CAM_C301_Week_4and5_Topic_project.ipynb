        "**Welcome to your topic project: Applying NLP for topic modelling in a real-life context**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, you will bridge the gap between theory and practical application by developing automated topic modelling tools tailored to a specific industry context.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying NLP for topic modelling is crucial for data analysis in business because it enables companies to identify and understand key themes and patterns within large volumes of text data. This efficiency allows businesses to extract essential insights and trends without manually sifting through extensive documents. Automated topic modelling helps businesses make informed decisions faster, which helps to improve productivity and gain a competitive edge. Additionally, it supports better information management by uncovering underlying topics in reports, emails, customer feedback, and market research, which enhances overall business intelligence and strategic planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Please set aside approximately **19 hours** to complete the topic project by **Thursday, 22 August at 5 p.m. (UK Time)**.\n",

        "## **Business context**\n",
        "\n",
        "The PureGym Group, founded in 2008, has approximately 2 million members and 600 gyms across the world (particularly in the UK, Denmark, and Switzerland). As one of the world’s largest value fitness operators, PureGym appeals to a broad range of customers by offering high-quality, low-cost, and flexible fitness facilities. The company’s customer-centric proposition – affordable membership fees, no fixed-term contracts, and 24/7 access to high-quality gyms – differentiates it from more traditional gyms and elevates it as a market leader within this space.\n",
        "\n",
        "This focus on the customer is centred on wanting to understand what motivates members to join and what factors influence their behaviours once they have joined. Understanding how to leverage innovative technology to influence, improve, and simplify their experience allows PureGym to foster an open, welcoming, and diverse environment for its members while maintaining the value proposition that PureGym is built upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the shift in focus to value-for-money memberships across the gym industry, PureGym seeks to achieve its mission of ‘inspiring a healthier world by providing members with affordable access to the benefits being healthy can offer’.\n",

        "\n",
        "By the end of this topic project, you will have analysed PureGym's review data to uncover key drivers that provide actionable insights for enhancing customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Notebook, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use two data sets containing customer reviews from Google and Trustpilot.\n",
        "- Perform basic level analysis by finding the frequently used words in both data sets.\n",
        "- Generate a wordcloud to visualise the most frequently used words in the reviews.\n",
        "- Apply BERTopic for topic modelling, keeping track of gym locations, to identify common topics and words in the negative reviews.\n",
        "- Identify the locations that have the most negative reviews.\n",
        "- Use the built-in visualisation functions in BERTopic to cluster and visually represent the topics and words in these reviews, thereby helping to identify specific themes from the reviews.\n",
        "- Conduct a comparison with Gensim’s LDA model to validate the topic modelling results.\n",
        "- Perform emotion analysis to identify the emotions associated with customer reviews.\n",
        "- Filter out angry reviews and apply BERTopic to discover prevalent topics and words being discussed these negative reviews.\n",
        "- Leverage the multi-purpose capability of the state-of-the-art Falcon-7b-instruct model, with the help of prompts, to identify top topics in each review.\n",
        "- Use a different prompt with the Falcon-7b-instruct model to further generate suggestions for improvements for PureGym, based on the top topics identified from the negative reviews.\n",

        "3. Import the data file **Trustpilot_12_months.xslx** into a dataframe.\n",
        "4. Remove any rows with missing values in the Comment column (Google review) and Review Content column (Trustpilot).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conducting initial data investigation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. - Find the number of unique locations in the Google data set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Find the number of unique locations in the Trustpilot data set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Use Club's Name for the Google data set.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Use Location Name for the Trustpilot data set.\n",
        "2. Find the number of common locations between the Google data set and the Trustpilot data set.\n",
        "3. Perform preprocessing of the data – change to lower case, remove stopwords using NLTK, and remove numbers.\n",
        "4. Tokenise the data using word_tokenize from NLTK.\n",
        "5. Find the frequency distribution of the words from each data set's reviews separately. You can use nltk.freqDist.\n",
        "6. Plot a histogram/bar plot showing the top 10 words from each data set.\n",
        "7. Use the wordcloud library on the cleaned data and plot the word cloud.\n",
        "8. Create a new dataframe by filtering out the data to extract only the negative reviews from both data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "  • For Google reviews, overall scores < 3 can be considered negative scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "  • For Trustpilot reviews, stars < 3 can be considered negative scores.\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Output: List out the top topics along with their document frequencies.\n",
        "4. For the top 2 topics, list out the top words.\n",
        "5. Show an interactive visualisation of the topics to identify the cluster of topics and to understand the intertopic distance map.\n",
        "6. Show a barchart of the topics, displaying the top 5 words in each topic.\n",
        "7. Plot a heatmap, showcasing the similarity matrix.\n",

        "3. For the top 30 locations, redo the word frequency and word cloud. Comment on the results, and highlight if the results are different from the first run.\n",
        "4. For the top 30 locations, combine the reviews from Google and Trustpilot and run them through BERTopic.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Comment on the following:\n",
        "\n",

        "3. Run this model on both data sets, and capture the top emotion for each review.\n",
        "4. Use a bar plot to show the top emotion distribution for all negative reviews in both data sets.\n",
        "5. Extract all the negative reviews (from both data sets) where anger is top emotion.\n",
        "6. Run BERTopic on the output of the previous step.\n",
        "7. Visualise the clusters from this run. Comment on whether it is any different from the previous runs, and whether it is possible to narrow down the primary issues that have led to an angry review.\n",
