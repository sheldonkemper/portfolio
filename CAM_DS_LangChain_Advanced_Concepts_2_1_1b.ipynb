You will be advised to register for an account at the OpenAI developer platform if you do not already have one. The provision of API keys is restricted to personal usage only and is subject to OpenAIâ€™s rate limits. At the time of writing this programme, a sufficient quota of API keys was being offered without charge, but a recent change at OpenAI required that anyone requesting free keys had to add a small credit to their account for the query to work.
